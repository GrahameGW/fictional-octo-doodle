## Rules of the road
Merge conflicts are a total PITA with git and Unity because of all the non-code assets. To maximize the time jamming and minimize the time we spend untangling:
- Develop to your own branch, push to remote, and merge there.
- Try to get someone else to merge your code. We have 4-6 programmers (depending on how you count), someone can help out
- Try to avoid working on changes to the same scene at the same time someone else is. It's obviously not going to be possible all the time, but if you can build your feature in a different scene do so.
- Have fun! It's a pretty chill schedule and a good group of people. Don't get hung up on so-called "best practices" or worry about spaghetti. There are zero long-term ramifications to your terrible design decisions, so just remember YAGNI and move on.
